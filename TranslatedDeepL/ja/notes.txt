It seems that when translating to japanese DeepL does not translate song lyrics well,
 it just keeps them in english. That is quite interesting and I do not know whether
 that is intentional or song lyrics are just hard to translate in the format they are now.

 Anyway this might either help or ruin the results, probably would be best to have
 actual japanese song lyrics for the lyrical register data.
 (the same might apply for the other small languages as well) 

 TLDR: translating using DeepL is not a good idea for the lyrical register.



 It would seem that there are some problems with movie information or concert information
  from fre to ja.
