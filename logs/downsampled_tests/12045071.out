 'text': ['On the Edge of the New World Plimoth Plantation Alan Villiers '
          'sailed a full-size replica of the ship Mayflower from England to '
          'New England in 1957.  In the same year, building had begun on '
          'Plimoth Plantation , a representation of the village set up by the '
          'Mayflower colonists. The town was named for the last place the '
          'settlers had seen in England in 1620.  Spelling was not '
          'standardised then.  The Plantation version was one of several used '
          'at the time and distinguished it from the name of the modern city '
          'close by.  The Mayflower i s moored alongside the State Pier there. '
          "Plimoth Plantation fulfilled the vision of 'Harry' Hornblower II "
          'who had spent boyhood holidays in Massachusetts.  He became '
          'fascinated with the stories of the Pilgrim Fathers and the symbolic '
          'landing point they were supposed to have first stepped onto -- the '
          "' Plymouth Rock' .  There is no documentary evidence to support the "
          'claim, and, in fact, the settlers actually made landfall near the '
          'tip of Cape Cod close to modern Provincetown.  They made their '
          'first permanent homes within a couple of hundred metres of where '
          'the Rock sits under a classical canopy dating from 1920. Hornblower '
          "opened a 'first house' representation on the waterfront in 1949, "
          'adding a second house and then a fort/meeting house soon after.  In '
          '1956, his family provided the land for the present village '
          'reconstruction, where building began the following year.  The fort '
          'was moved there.  It now acts as the main entrance to the '
          "colonists' village project, with many houses with their backyards, "
          "workshops and fields with sheep, cattle and goats. Native 'wigwams' "
          'were set up in 1964.  Costumed guides described life in the colony '
          'and the ways in which the houses had been furnished with antiques.  '
          'Mannequins were placed to represent the inhabitants.  It depicted '
          'the village as it might have been in 1627 when it really stood '
          'where the city is today. In the late 1970s, staff began to try out '
          'techniques that had been established in other US museums such as '
          'Old Sturbridge, also in Massachusetts, and a few places in '
          'Britain.  This was First Person Interpretation.  They adopted '
          'well-researched roles based on real historical people, their lives '
          'and characters.  Visitors found themselves being greeted as if they '
          'were seventeenth century travellers.  Careful training by '
          'linguistic specialists prepared them to use one of seventeen local '
          'or regional English dialects with appropriate vocabulary.  '
          'Meticulous preparation allowed them to deal with questions about '
          'village life and the culture of the colony.  Suitable ways of '
          'responding to visitors who referred to twentieth century features '
          'such as fridges or automobiles were devised.  These glossed over '
          'such things by saying something like "you will have your new '
          'devices; we have to make use of what we can". In the late 1960s, a '
          'crucial development began to appear.  People from the nearby Native '
          'American community, the Wampanoag, were drawn in to operate a '
          "'summer camp' Native Village alongside the Pilgrim Village.  It "
          "gradually established close to the settlers' homes but with its "
          'distinct style and culture.  Wampanoag huts, crops and craftwork '
          'were placed on view and in the hands of Native peoples.  The route '
          'in to the main village from the museum entrance runs through the '
          'Wampanoag site, taking visitors in the correct historical stages of '
          'Native America being followed by settlers arriving from England. '
          'Other museums have had to move away from the white European view of '
          'the United States.  Black slave history is the subject of the '
          'National Underground Railroad Freedom Centre in Cincinnati.  The '
          'Magnolia Plantation and Gardens near Charleston has been restoring '
          'slave huts for visitors to see.  Native American life and culture '
          'is so far on show in small centres and archaeological sites.  But '
          'Colonial Williamsburg, an important museum and town in Virginia '
          'with key War of Independence connections, has been building up the '
          'depiction of black history slowly over some decades.  Sited in a '
          'prominent slave state the role of black people was central to life '
          'in Williamsburg.  The problem has been twofold.  As a museum '
          'devoted to the mid-eighteenth century, it has to have black folk '
          'shown in slave and servant roles, which can reinforce a status that '
          'is no longer acceptable.  At the same time, at least in the 1950s '
          'and 60s, the museum could only go so far in placing black people in '
          'more important staff positions as some whites opposed such moves. '
