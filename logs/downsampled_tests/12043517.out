 'text': ['Five common nightmares - and what they mean Dream interpreters '
          'claim there are many common symbols that occur in nightmares all '
          'over the world. This, they believe, is down to a shared human '
          'experience through the ages and means such symbols can be used like '
          'a language, providing a key to unlocking their meaning. American '
          'psychotherapist Dr Alex Lukeman claims once you have identified the '
          'main symbols and their general meaning you should work out how they '
          'relate to your own personal experiences - and then act on what your '
          'nightmare is trying to tell you. Here are five of the most common '
          'nightmares - and what they symbolise Spiders Spiders are often '
          'negative symbols in our dreams because they are seen as frightening '
          'by so much of society and often represent a controlling or '
          'ensnaring force. For men (and some women) spiders can represent '
          "something about women or a specific woman. 'Spiders are also a very "
          "old form of life,' says Dr Lukeman. 'One of the things they "
          'represent in dreams is something very primitive and basic - '
          'something rooted in the depth of our being, such as our mother. For '
          'someone who comes from a family where the mother was unloving , a '
          'spider can be a perfect dream symbol. The evil mother becomes and '
          "evil spider. ' Spiders can also symbolise an evil male force. It "
          "could be an overbearing boss, father or lover. 'If you are in a "
          'relationship unsettling to you and you have a spider dream, think '
          "carefully about what is taking place,' says Dr Lukeman. 'Are you "
          'fooling yourself about the other person? Is he or she what he '
          "appears to be? Honor your instincts and feelings.' Health problems "
          'Dr Lukeman says dreams about health problems can work on different '
          'levels - but says they can often actually be an indication of real '
          "illness. 'Something in ourselves understands everything that goes "
          "on in our body,' he says. 'If you think about it something keeps "
          'our bodies ticking over and running as they should without us '
          "thinking about it,' he says. 'And this thing often knows if "
          'something is wrong with us and will try to tell us. I have had many '
          'patients who have discovered hidden health problems through their '
          "dreams.' Common symbols for health problems are dreaming of a "
          'specific ailment and primitive, evil fish at the bottom of the sea. '
          "'This relates to the fact that the bottom of the sea often "
          "represents the depth of our consciousness,' he says. But Dr Lukeman "
          'is keen to stress that dreams about health do not always indicate '
          "actual health problems. 'Dreams about health can often simply "
          "indicate a more general concern about your life,' he says Running "
          'for your life Dr Lukeman claims running is linked to the primitive '
          'days of our cavemen ancestors where life was short and dangerous '
          'and there was a real possibility of being chased by beasts of prey. '
          "'Our brain still contains areas dominant during the earliest stages "
          "of human development,' he says. 'These parts of our brain respond "
          'instinctively to danger or stress, sounding the alarm and preparing '
          'us for flight or battle. Fear and danger trigger the instinctive '
          'response: the urge is to run, run faster than the thing that is '
          "after us.' He advises trying to identify what is 'chasing' you in "
          'real life. This could be anything that is overwhelming you in an '
          'emotional, mental or physical sense, from work to a relationship, '
          "then identifying what you can do to alter things. 'Chase dreams "
          "signal ideas of helplessness,' he says. 'Do something to regain a "
          'sense of control over your life. It could be something as simple as '
          're-arranging your day to include time for yourself to relax. It '
          'could be as complex as leaving a bad relationship or an '
          "unfulfilling job.' Teeth Dreaming that your teeth are falling out "
          "is one of the most common nightmares of all. 'Teeth are used to "
          'speak and communicate, to chew food, to protect and attack (in more '
          'primitive times), to convey feelings, and have a cosmetic value in '
          "a world where good looks are valued highly,' says Dr Lukeman. For "
          'this reason teeth dreams can relate to many areas of your life: '
          'from feelings that you are not being heard or acknowledged or a '
          'feeling that you are not able to express yourself properly or a '
          "feeling that you are not in control of a situation. 'Ask yourself "
          "if you feel frustrated about the way people listen to you,' says Dr "
          "Lukeman. 'Perhaps you need to improve your communication skills. If "
          'you have the dream more than',
          'In reply to "Uniformly continuous", posted by Pasha on Nov 10, '
          '2003: &gt;Show that the requirement in the definition of uniform '
          'continuity can be &gt;rephrased as follows, in terms of diameters '
          'of sets: To every eps&gt;0 there &gt;exists a delta&gt;0 such that '
          'diam(F(E))&lt;eps for all E in X with &gt;diam(E)&lt;delta. Let f '
          "be uniformly continuous. Let e&gt;0 be given, and let d'&gt;0 be "
          'found according to the definition uniform continuity, such that d '
          "corresponds to e/2. So we know: d(x,y) &lt; d' --&gt; d(f(x),f(y)) "
          '&lt; e/2, for all x and y in the domain of f. We claim that this d '
          'works. If E is such that diam(E) &lt; d, we have to show that '
          'diam(f(E)) &lt; e. To this end, let p and q be points of f(E). So '
          'p=f(x), for some x in E, and q=f(y), for some y in E. As diam(E) '
          '&lt; d, we know that d(x,y) &lt; d, so d(f(x),f(y)) = d(p,q) &lt; '
          'e/2. this is true for ALL p,q in f(E), so diam(f(E)) = sup{d(a,b): '
          'a,b in f(E)} &lt;= e/2 &lt; e. This is what we wanted. Now let f '
          'satisfy the diameter-property. We want to show that f is uniformly '
          'continuous, so let e&gt;0 be given. Let d &gt; 0 be found for the '
          'diameter-property applied to this e. If now x and y are points of '
          'the domain of f with d(x,y) &lt; d, we know that diam({x,y}) = '
          'd(x,y) &lt; d, so diam(f({x,y})) = d(f(x),f(y)) &lt; e by the '
          'property and we are done.']}
