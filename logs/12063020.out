 'text': ['Bringing Down the Barriers: The Labour Market and Women with '
          'Disabilities in Ontario by Gail Fawcett Section 3: Social attitudes '
          'Focus group participants in all groups mentioned negative social '
          'attitudes and lack of public awareness as two of the top three '
          'barriers that they faced when trying to enter or stay in the paid '
          'labour market. The problem begins with a lack of awareness about '
          'disabilities and disability issues. One factor that was brought up '
          'repeatedly was the negative impact of highly visible disabilities. '
          'Some participants noted that people often have a fear of being '
          'around persons with highly visible disabilities. "People just don?t '
          'want to look at us. They don?t want us around as reminders that '
          'this could be them at some point in the future." As well, some '
          'highly visible disabilities can mask the true potential and '
          'capabilities of persons with disabilities. As a result, negative '
          'judgements are placed upon individuals because their speech or '
          'appearance is not "normal." "People think I?m drunk because of the '
          'way my eyes look." "People look at my disability and they hear my '
          'speech. I can?t leave those things in the waiting room when I go '
          'for an interview. Whenever I have actually got a job, I always had '
          'positive feedback. But they were all short-term jobs. Attitude is '
          'my biggest barrier." Women with learning disabilities commented '
          'that they were typically treated like children and not given credit '
          'when they had performed well on the job because attitudes in their '
          'workplace were such that no one believed that they could have '
          'actually done the job on their own. "When people asked: ?Did you do '
          'that? Who helped you?? It really hurt. You wonder if you should '
          'tell anyone that you have a learning disability. If they know, they '
          'might be able to give you the supports on the job. But if you do '
          'tell them, they never take your abilities seriously again." Women '
          'with developmental disabilities face enormous attitudinal barriers. '
          'They also feel that they are "treated like children" or aren?t '
          '"trusted." However, when given the opportunity and the right job, '
          'these women are quite capable of working in the paid labour market '
          'and living independently. "I used to work in a sheltered workshop. '
          'I never thought I would ever have a real job. Then I began what was '
          'supposed to be a two-month contract. But they renewed and renewed ? '
          'it?s nine years later and I?m still employed." Those who don?t have '
          'a visible disability also experience negative attitudes. When it '
          'came to matters involving the labour market and social services, '
          'many of the focus group participants voiced the belief that while '
          'social attitudes toward persons with disabilities improved over the '
          '1980s, they have deteriorated over the course of the 1990s. "It '
          'breaks my heart that society has devolved into a very hateful '
          'society. I?m concerned about the future for all of us." "When '
          'employment gets tight, prejudices surface." Women in our focus '
          'groups also noted that public attitudes and their own situation had '
          'an impact on their self-esteem. This can often lead to low '
          'self-esteem, lack of confidence and poor performance in job '
          'interviews. "I had to fight to get homecare to come in twice a week '
          'to help me have a bath. Do you know what it?s like going for a job '
          'interview a few days after your last bath?" While both women and '
          'men with disabilities face these attitudinal barriers, women also '
          'fight gender bias. Although women with disabilities have a high '
          'degree of financial responsibility within their households, they '
          'report that employers often still believe that they are being taken '
          'care of by someone else and don?t really need to work for pay. '
          'Sexism interacts with disability in other ways. One woman who '
          'required a special seat to sit in her wheelchair had her request to '
          'a local service club turned down because "they said that they only '
          'provide assistance to men." Visible minority women with '
          'disabilities often feel that they have an additional mark against '
          'them. Several in our focus groups mentioned that they felt racial '
          'discrimination compounded the challenges of being female and having '
          'a disability. However, they were reluctant to attribute past '
          'negative experiences solely to racial discrimination. Some felt '
          'that they had so many factors working against them that they '
          'couldn?t be sure how much of their situation could be attributed to '
          'their race. "Is it because of my language, my race, my disability, '
          'or because I?m a woman? Why am I not being hired?" One of the most '
          'illustrative examples of the complex interplay of attitudes toward '
          'race, disability, and gender can be found in ERDCO?s 1996 study, '
          'entitled Including Us . . . Ethno Racial People with Disabilities '
          'speak out on issues of race and disability : One woman?s horrifying '
          'story illustrates the multiple oppressions which women are often '
          'subjected to. As a Muslim woman, she adhered to certain norms of '
          'modesty and covered her hair. Some of her female co-workers wanted '
          'to see her without her hijab (head covering) and she showed them a '
          'picture of herself which she carried in her purse. Her co-workers '
          'later took the picture out of her bag and photocopied it on top a '
          'likeness of a naked woman. They wrote "I love sex" on the picture '
          'and stuck it on the back of her wheelchair. The woman spent part of '
          'the day moving about in a public space and no one warned her of its '
          'existence. It was only when she was going home that someone told '
          'her about the picture. "I felt humiliated. They tormented me as a '
          'minority woman, they violated my religious beliefs and they mocked '
          'my disability. Through this single obscene act they managed to '
          'attack me on several levels." 34 Finally, focus group participants '
          'called for more public education regarding disability. By '
          'increasing awareness and understanding of disability, it is hoped '
          'that other, more tangible, barriers might fall. Attitudes and '
          'awareness were mentioned in almost every focus group as an area '
          'needing improvement: "Attitude is the biggest barrier. People have '
          'to be retrained to know that we have grown with the times and that '
          'we can do things." "Just to show you what we?re up against, a dear '
          'friend of mine who is blind went to a restaurant with a group of '
          'people, and the maitre d? asked: ?Smoking section or non-smoking '
          'section?? She answered: ?Non-smoking please.? He then asked: ?What '
          'about the (guide) dog?? She answered: ?Oh, I guess you could put '
          'him in the smoking section!? " ',

          'work for a magazine, fret no more. Tonight is the Blue & White’s '
          'meeting, your opportunity to make all your dreams come true. We’ll '
